Intro on JavaScript:-

javascript is a high level programming language for building web application more efficient way.
- javascript works on both client side as well as server side rendering.
- javascript is comes from echms script so we see the latest version of javascript in the form of echma script.
- Now we used javascript version 6 i.e ES6 (echma script 6).
- In another way we called Esg as the vanilla javaScript.

Variable:-
- variable is a container to store some data.
there are 3 types of variable present in javascript:
1. let :-
-> let is a type of variable which is used to changeing the variable name later.
-> Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
-> let is the block scope code so we have been using let for most cases.

2. var:-
-> var is a types of variable which is also used to changing the variable latter stage.
-> var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are dont use var most of the cases.

3. const:
-> const is a types of variable where we can't change our data further.
-> const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc...

Rules for creating variable name :-
- variable names are case sensative "a", & "A" is different.
- only letter, digit, underscore & $ is allowed(not even space.)
- only letter, underscore or $ should be the first charecter only.
- reversed words cannot be variable.
Home work:-
